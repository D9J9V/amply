# Walrus Storage Test Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the enhanced Walrus storage test implementation at `/app/test/walrus/page.tsx` for the Amply project.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Enhanced Upload Component with Real XMLHttpRequest
- **Real Progress Tracking**: Uses XMLHttpRequest instead of fetch to get actual upload progress events
- **Progress Bar**: Visual progress indicator that updates in real-time during uploads
- **CORS Proxy**: Created `/api/walrus-proxy/route.ts` to handle browser-based uploads without CORS issues

### 2. Two-Phase Upload Process
- **Phase 1 - Draft Upload**: First uploads file with `deletable=true` flag for testing
- **Phase 2 - Permanent Upload**: Uploads the same file permanently 
- **Phase 3 - Metadata Upload**: Creates and uploads JSON metadata as a separate blob
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows current phase and progress for each step

### 3. Metadata Storage
- **Track Metadata Structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Track Name",
    "artist": "Artist Name", 
    "duration": 180,
    "blobId": "xyz123...",
    "worldIdVerified": true,
    "uploadedAt": "2025-07-05T..."
  }
  ```
- **Automatic Duration Detection**: Extracts duration from audio files during selection
- **World ID Verification Flag**: Checkbox to simulate World ID verified uploads
- **Metadata Linking**: Metadata blob references the audio/video blob ID

### 4. Streaming Playback
- **Direct Walrus URLs**: Uses aggregator endpoint for streaming: `https://aggregator.walrus-testnet.walrus.space/v1/blobs/{blobId}`
- **Range Request Support**: Walrus aggregator supports HTTP range requests for efficient streaming
- **Buffering Indicators**: Shows loading spinner when audio is buffering
- **Playback Status**: Displays current playback state (playing/paused)

## Technical Implementation

### Response Handling
The implementation handles multiple Walrus response formats:
- `newlyCreated.blobObject` - For new uploads
- `alreadyCertified` - For duplicate content
- Direct response format - Simplified response structure

### File Structure
```
/app/test/walrus/page.tsx         # Main test page with all features
/app/api/walrus-proxy/route.ts    # CORS proxy for browser uploads
```

### Environment Variables
Added to `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALRUS_PUBLISHER_URL=https://publisher.walrus-testnet.walrus.space
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALRUS_AGGREGATOR_URL=https://aggregator.walrus-testnet.walrus.space
```

## UI Features
- **Grid Layout**: Two-column layout on desktop, single column on mobile
- **Dark Mode Support**: Full dark mode compatibility with Tailwind CSS
- **Status Indicators**: Shows test results for each feature
- **Error Handling**: Displays clear error messages if uploads fail
- **Blob Management**: Lists all uploaded blobs with metadata display

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the development server**: `pnpm dev`
2. **Navigate to**: http://localhost:3000/test/walrus
3. **Test upload flow**:
   - Select an audio or video file
   - Enter track metadata (title, artist)
   - Check "World ID Verified" if desired
   - Click "Start Two-Phase Upload"
   - Watch the progress through all three phases
4. **Test playback**:
   - Click on any uploaded blob in the list
   - Click "Load Selected Content for Streaming"
   - Use the audio player controls

## Known Limitations
- Maximum file size depends on Walrus network limits
- Actual World ID verification is mocked (checkbox only)
- Metadata is stored separately and not automatically retrieved with audio blobs

## Future Enhancements
- Add metadata retrieval when loading blobs
- Implement playlist functionality
- Add waveform visualization
- Support for cover art uploads
- Integration with actual World ID verification
