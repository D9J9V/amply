## üéØ Testing Tips

1. **Start with World ID**: Test human verification first as it's used by other features
2. **Use Small Files**: For Walrus, start with files under 5MB for faster testing
3. **Check Console**: All demos log detailed information for debugging
4. **Dark Mode**: All pages support dark mode - try toggling your system theme
5. **Error States**: Try operations without prerequisites to see error handling

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

- **MiniKit Not Installed**: Install World App and enable developer mode
- **CORS Errors**: Walrus uses a proxy at `/api/walrus-proxy` to handle browser restrictions
- **Large Files**: Walrus uploads may timeout for very large files (>50MB)
- **WalletConnect**: The Ledger demo shows mock data - real pairing requires Ledger Live

## üöÄ Next Steps

After testing these demos, the components can be integrated into the main Amply application:
- World ID verification for all content access
- Walrus storage for permanent, decentralized media hosting
- Ledger integration for secure NFT ownership transfers
